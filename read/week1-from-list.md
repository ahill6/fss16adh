### ii. Keywords
ii1: Discrete Time Markov Chain - 

ii2: PCTL (Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic) - 

ii3: Finite State Machine - 

ii4: Dynamic System - 

### iii. A Few Notes
iii1: Motivation - 

iii2: New Results - 

iii3: Patterns - Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to discussing circumstances under which the use of synthetic data is most appropriate and beneficial.  In addition to a general overview, specific examples of appropriate cases and the type of questions that should be asked are provided.

iii4: Future Work - 


### iv. Weaknesses
iv1: Diction/grammar - On the whole the paper had good grammar and used words appropriately, but some portions had grammar/spelling errors which distracted from the text - particularly in section 5.  A proofreader could have prevented this.

iv2: Sets a very broad agenda in multiple areas - The purpose of the paper is to set an agenda for future work, so to some extent broad strokes are expected.  However, the paper loses a bit of focus as it addresses philosophy of science (empiricism vice experimentalism), and describes multiple distinct potential research areas without any discussion of how (or whether) research in each could interact.

iv3: Even an agenda paper needs to suggest a future direction - On the whole, the paper offers very little in the way of concrete suggestions, preferring to simply point out the problems.  The exception to this critique is the section on synthetic data.
