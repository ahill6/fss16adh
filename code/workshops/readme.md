[Code][gafsm] for workshop 3 (GA+POM3).  The "TODO" tags are still in it, so it should be easy to search through and find my changes.  
Additional comments are not necessary, since the TODO sections explain what the code does and the vast majority of the code was reused from the previous workshops.
