### Notes on Homework
Some aspects of my submissions are different from the directions (in ways that I assume to not be important).  These are listed below:
+ The screenshots for chapter 4 are titled 4.2 and 4.3 rather than _2 and _3 in a different folder
+ The polygons in the text are tilted at a slight angle, my polypie method does not tilt them
